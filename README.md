**Conclusion** - It was not possible to determine if one service was more expensive than another. However, there were some other observations found such as Ubers prices were more cluster than Lyfts. This means that is you were to get a price for a ride and then decide to wait, there is a higher chance the price would very more with Lyft than with Uber. There is a higher chance to hit a surge with Lyft at 3pm and 3am. Wednesdays are the best day for a ride with Lyft as the likelyhood for a surge is at the lowest point. If you are looking to save money using Lyft between 8am-1pm and after 9pm are your best chance for avoiding the surges.
